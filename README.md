# Professional Self-Assessment
## Starting From Scratch
When I first began my journey toward earning a bachelor’s degree in computer science, I had no prior experience with computers. Everything—from programming to foundational math and science—was completely new to me. I started from the ground up with basic courses, including Visual Basic programming, and even had to retake some computer science classes just to fully grasp the concepts. It wasn’t an easy start, but I was committed to learning. My interest in tech stemmed from an idea I had for an app—one that would combine social media with the ability to check out and reserve spots at different establishments. I figured, instead of paying someone to build it for me, why not take on the career path and learn to build it myself?
## Military Background and Career Pivot
Before stepping into the world of computer science, I served in the United States Air Force for eight years. The structure and discipline I gained during my service helped shape how I approached challenges in the academic world. My time in the military gave me the resilience I would need for this long, winding educational journey. Transitioning from the Air Force into tech was a major shift, but one driven by passion and a desire to create. I didn’t want to be just a consumer of technology—I wanted to be a creator.
## Balancing Life and Education
As I progressed through my degree, life threw some major changes my way. I got married and had a child, which meant I had to prioritize supporting my family. I found an opportunity in 2017 to intern at Charles Schwab on an architecture team, where I worked on data integration using tools like Informatica and SQL Server. My days started at 6 a.m. and ended with night classes at MSU Denver. It was exhausting, and after a semester, I knew I needed a more flexible way to complete my education. That’s when I made the decision to transfer to Southern New Hampshire University and finish my degree online.
## Transitioning to SNHU and Academic Growth
Luckily, many of my credits transferred smoothly to SNHU, allowing me to pick up where I left off. This transition gave me the flexibility to manage my family life while still making progress toward my degree. Over the years, I took courses I never imagined myself taking—like calculus and game development. I learned about graphics programming, web development, databases, and more. I was no longer just a beginner, I had developed a strong technical foundation and a deeper understanding of how software systems work.
## New Passions and Career Goals
Along the way, I also discovered new passions. One of my dream jobs is working in sports data analytics—possibly with a professional team—analyzing player performance and helping coaches make informed decisions. I’ve also grown a strong interest in fashion. I envision building my own fashion platform where I can sell curated, thrifted clothing in a creative and tech-driven way. These interests have helped shape how I see myself using my degree—not just for traditional roles, but to pursue ideas that align with who I am.
## Looking Forward
This degree journey has opened my eyes to the many roles in tech beyond just sitting behind a screen writing code. I’ve gained the technical skills and confidence to start thinking about project management, cloud architecture, and other leadership or strategic positions. Now that I have the foundation, I plan to pursue certifications in project management to complement my experience building and organizing software projects. Whether I go into cloud systems, data analytics, or build my own platform, I know the knowledge and determination I’ve developed through this degree will carry me forward.
